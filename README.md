# InstaPix- fetch photos uploaded on Instagram by a user and display them in a staggered grid view

uses the following libraries:
  #SocialAuth for Instagram login
  #Picasso for displaying images from url
  #etsyStaggeredGrid to display images in a staggered grid
  
Since the app is in sandbox mode, Instagram allows access to only 20 most recent media. Also, the API can be accessed only by the users invited by the admin(max limit is 10). To allow a user, log in as the admin and add the user name under the "sandbox" tab of your client app. The invited user needs to accept your invitation to be able to log in to the app.  Read details in the following documentation (https://www.instagram.com/developer/sandbox/)

The project was built in Eclipse, using Android 6.0.
